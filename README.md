GENERATOR OF PROFESSIONAL CARDS
Developed with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and SASS.

This is a web site developed by one of Adalab's groups from Fairfax class, and is our second project as team.

We have used:

*Advanced use of HTML forms
*Layout using advanced CSS, such as flex and grid
*Use of mediaqueries so that the design is adaptable to the device using the mobile first strategy
*Management of events in the browser (when clicking, passes x, etc.)
*Access and sending data on the Internet through requests to the server
*Local storage using LocalStorage
*Use of git to control project versions
*Publication of the result on the Internet using GitHub Pages

The project consists of 2 pages
*a welcome page
*a page with the application to create cards

We hope you can enjoy it! :)
